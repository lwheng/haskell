# Zalora Scraper (Work in Progress)

A Haskell program that scrapes Zalora.sg for data

This is my attempt on scraping zalora.sg for the product data, as part of the task posted by Zalora

The following is the description of the task:
```
Please scrape every page on zalora.sg, and return 2 columns in gzipped CSV format, 
containing the first 20 SKUs displayed on each page and the page 
name (which has the format shop.pc.X.Y) 
```
